# Don't change the formatting of this file, or Bukkit will complain. To reset this file to default, just delete it. 
# We recommend using VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) to modify this file, as it will help you with formatting.
# Do NOT use tabs (tab indent) - use spaces. VS Code will automatically insert spaces, but other text editors won't.

# Any changes to this file are applied immediately, no reload needed.


# Prompts let you create interactive menus and conversations, which can be used to access commands and information in-game.
# Each file in the prompts folder can contain multiple prompts.
# To display prompts in-game, use the command "/prompts display [player name] <fileName.promptName>"
# For example, to display this prompt in game, you can use "/prompts display @p example.promptTest"


# All prompts must be listed under the file name.
example:


  # This is an example prompt. Can be named anything. Name must be unique in the file, and is not case sensitive.
  prompttest:

    # The Question section is where you can list text. Usually this will ask some sort of question, which the player can choose an answer to.
    question:
      - "This is a RealmsCore example prompt!"
      - "What would you like to do?"

    # Answers is the clickable text, and action is what happens when it's clicked. The first answer corresponds to the first action, and so on.
    # Remember that the "answers" and "actions" list must always be the same length!
    answers:
      - "Show general server help."
      - "Go to the server spawn."
      - "Learn more about the Prompts system."

    # Actions begin with a type:
    # -  command - run a command (do not include the "/"). The command is run as the player, so if the player doesn't have permission, the command won't run.
    # -  prompt - show a different prompt (in the format of fileName.promptName)
    # -  url - open a webpage
    # Other plugins can add additional action types.
    actions:
     - "prompt_help.main"
     - "command_spawn"
     - "url_http://wolfiamc.com/plugins/realmscore/prompts"




  # A different example prompt, intended to be a conversation.
  # When RealmsStory is installed, you can use prompts to create NPC dialogue. This is called a conversation.
  # They're exactly like normal prompts, but instead of being displayed from a command (or command block), they show when interacting with an NPC.
  # RealmsStory is another plugin in the Realms suite. Learn more at http://wolfiamc.com/plugins/

      - "Where is the mall?"
      - "Where is the library?"
      - "Can I build here?"

    # Since this is just an example, the following prompts don't actually exist. You can change this or create your own prompts.
