# Don't change the formatting of this file, or Bukkit will complain. To reset this file to default, just delete it. 
# We recommend using VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) to modify this file, as it will help you with formatting.

# This prompt file is used for the /help command. Put your server information and help here.
# Prompts let you have multiple help pages, for different topics. Six are included as examples.
# This is all based off the official server, so you'll want to customize the information for your server, otherwise it might confuse players.

  # The main prompt is used when "/help" is typed on its own. 
  # In this example, it's used as a menu, leading to specific help topics. You can change this and put all your info in main, if you prefer.
