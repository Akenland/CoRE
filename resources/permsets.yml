# Don't change the formatting of this file, or Bukkit will complain. To reset this file to default, just delete it. 
# We recommend using VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) to modify this file, as it will help you with formatting.
# Do NOT use tabs (tab indent) - use spaces. VS Code will automatically insert spaces, but other text editors won't.

# Any changes to this file are applied on login, or when switching sets. No reload needed. 


# This file contains all the permission sets used on your server. This is where you list permission nodes.
# A player can only have one permission set active at a time (but can be allowed to switch between multiple permission sets).

# Five example sets are included and pre-configured here, but you can have any number of sets.

sets:

  ### Basic permission set
  ### This set should be available to everyone. Additionally, all other sets should "inherit" it (more on that below).
  basic:

    # These are the permissions included in this set. You can add or remove items to allow/deny players to access them.
    permissions:
      # General server commands
      - core.player
      - core.realm
      - core.realm.set
      - core.realm.players
      - core.realm.officers
      - core.realm.titles
      - core.afk
      - core.msg
      - core.pack

      # Allows switching between permission sets. It's important that everyone has this, otherwise players won't be able to switch to other permission sets they have.
      - core.permissions.setswitch

      # Teleport & Warpstones permissions (if the Warpstones plugin is installed)
      - warpstones.tp

  ### Builder utility set
  ### As the name suggests, you might set this as the utility set for your "builder rank" players. Designed to be survival-friendly.
  builder_utility:

    # This inheritedSets section lets you copy all permissions from another set, instead of retyping all of them.
    # You'll almost always want to copy the permissions from the basic set.
    inheritedSets:
      - basic
    
    # Then, as before, list the permission nodes.
    permissions:
      # Some commands to help builders get around easily
      - core.fly
      - core.speed
