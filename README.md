# Project CoRE
A Bukkit plugin that provides a roleplaying framework and server essentials, for small/medium survival and roleplay servers.

Project CoRE is the foundation of our roleplaying experience, with  Characters and Realms, plus Extras that include everything a small/medium server may need. All features are highly configurable (and easily disabled if not needed), and are designed to be lightweight and easy to use.

# Features
## Realms
A simple, yet expandable factions system that lets players team up and roleplay as nations, known as realms.

These nations can be sub-divided and customized, allowing for roleplaying scenarios such as High Kings ruling vast kingdoms, appointing Jarls to govern regions and towns.

Project CoRE only provides a basic framework, giving players the freedom to roleplay, but the system can be infinitely expanded with plugins that add unique gameplay.

## Permissions
Breaking away from traditional server ranks, Project CoRE includes a permissions system that fades into the background: perfect for survival and roleplay servers. Players can switch between multiple sets of permissions, such as a basic utilities set for survival mode, while still having full cheats for building and staff abilities.

Security is a priority, with multiple checks so players only get the right privileges. Even if an admin account is hacked, permissions are locked down with Admin Multi-Check, so your server stays safe.

## Extras
Enhanced server commands, simple world management, entity management, and more are all included.

Clickable prompts, so you donâ€™t have to memorize and type out dozens of lengthy commands. You can even make your own interactive prompts.
Action bar messages keep the chat from getting cluttered with every command you run.

User-friendly, smartly-designed features, and more lightweight on your server than many other all-in-one plugins.

## Developer Features
Prompts allow you to click on actions, instead of memorizing and typing commands. They are used throughout all Akenland plugins.

Unified Player Data files make it easy for multiple plugins to store data in one place, reducing the number of files on your server. Unlike many plugins, Project CoRE is smart enough to only save data when needed, instead of pointlessly creating files for every single player who joins your server.
