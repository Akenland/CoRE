# Don't change the formatting of this file, or Bukkit will complain. To reset this file to default, just delete it. 
# We recommend using VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) to modify this file, as it will help you with formatting.
# Do NOT use tabs (tab indent) - use spaces. VS Code will automatically insert spaces, but other text editors won't.

# Any changes to this file are applied on login, or when switching sets. No reload needed. 


# This file is where you list the permission sets that are available to each player.

players:

  # This "everyone" section is where you list the permission sets available to everyone on the server, including those not listed below.
  everyone:
    permissions:
      # The "basic" set is default for everyone, meaning that it is applied on login.
      default: basic

      # The set is also listed under instantAccess, so if players switch to a different set, they can switch back to basic at any time.
      instantAccess:
        - basic



  # Players are listed by UUID. Type "/player <name>" in-game to get UUIDs. Clicking the UUID will open a website where you can copy it.


  # Here's an example, for Kyle_Necrowolf (developer of RealmsCore).
  # If Kyle_Necrowolf joins your server, these permission sets will be available to him.
  c7a0e7df-5141-4344-b119-9f1102e5178c:
    permissions:
      # Kyle will have the permissions from the "builder_utility" set when he logs on. If you don't specify a default, the one from "everyone" above will be used.
      default: builder_utility
      # The utility and cheat sets are accessed via shortcut commands "/utility" and "/cheat". 
      utility: admin_utility
      cheat: admin_cheat

      # Kyle has instant access to builder_utility, so he can manually switch to it anytime.
      instantAccess:
      - builder_utility

      # Kyle has admin supervised access to admin_utility, meaning that another admin must be online to supervise, before Kyle can use this permission set.
      adminSupervised:
      - admin_utility

      # Notice how admin_cheat isn't listed again? if you don't specify instantAccess or adminSupervised, it will default to requiring an admin to approve it.
      # If an admin doesn't approve it, the player can't use those permissions!



  # Here's another example, for Dinnerbone (Minecraft developer).
  61699b2e-d327-4a01-9f1e-0ea8c3f06bc6:
    permissions:
      # Here we're only going to specify a utility set. Because "everyone" has "default: basic", Dinnerbone will also have that automatically.
      utility: admin_utility



  # Here's an example of how to give another player the same permissions, for jeb_ (lead developer of Minecraft)
  853c80ef-3c37-49fd-aa49-938b674adae6:
    # Instead of listing permission sets, put "inherit: " to copy all permissions from another player.
    # In this case, we're inheriting Dinnerbone's permissions.
    inherit: 61699b2e-d327-4a01-9f1e-0ea8c3f06bc6



  # You can also list permission sets under arbitrary names, and have players inherit them.
  # This is useful if you have a lot of players with the same permissions, like a builder rank.
  builder:
    permissions:
      utility: builder_utility
      cheat: builder_cheat



  # Now we can inherit those permissions, and even add to them. Using GalvinNerth as an example (contributor to the plugin and an admin of the official server).
  47abe964-563f-45b7-80ec-f5c6b366b2f1:
    inherit: builder
    permissions:
      # Galvin will have access to the inherited builder_utility set when an admin is online to supervise.
      adminSupervised:
      - builder_utility



  # Here's an example for an "admin rank".
  admin:
    permissions:
      default: admin_utility
      utility: admin_utility
      cheat: admin_cheat

      # If you want to give more sets than just default/utility/cheat, list them under "other".
      other:
      - builder_utility
      - builder_cheat

      instantAccess:
      - builder_utility
      - builder_cheat
      - admin_utility



  # You can put your UUID here to get your own permissions set up quickly.
  put-your-uuid-here:
    # This "admin: true" line is part of Admin Multi-Check. If this line is missing, you won't be able to use all admin commands.
    # This cannot be inherited. It must be explicitly listed for each admin player.
    admin: true
    
    # Inherit from the "admin" section above, and give yourself instant access to admin_cheat, so you can get access to all server commands.
    inherit: admin
    permissions:
      instantAccess:
      - admin_cheat

  

  # Got another admin? You can just put their UUID here.
  put-another-admin's-uuid-here:
    admin: true
    inherit: admin
    # They'll have access to admin_utility and the two builder sets any time, but need your approval to use the permissions in admin_cheat.
