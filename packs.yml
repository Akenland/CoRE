# Don't change the formatting of this file, or Bukkit will complain. To reset this file to default, just delete it. 
# We recommend using VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) to modify this file, as it will help you with formatting.
# Do NOT use tabs (tab indent) - use spaces. VS Code will automatically insert spaces, but other text editors won't.

# Any changes to this file are applied immediately, no reload needed.


# This file can have multiple resource packs listed, allowing players to download and use any listed pack.
# Players can choose a pack with "/pack <pack name>".
# To send a pack to another player (such as with command blocks), use "/pack <pack name> <player>"
# Add "setdefault" to the end of either command to set it as the player's default pack. It will be automatically applied on next login.
